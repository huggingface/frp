# Gradio Share Server (FRP)

This repo is a fork of [Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP)](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), which runs on Gradio's Share Server to enable Gradio's [Share links](https://www.gradio.app/guides/sharing-your-app#sharing-demos). Instructions on how to set up your own Share Server to generate *custom* share links are below ðŸ”¥

## Background

When you create a Gradio app and launch it with `share=True` like this:

```py
import gradio as gr

app = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, "image", "image")
app.launch(share=True)
```

you get a share link like: `https://07ff8706ab.gradio.live`, and your Gradio app is now accessible to anyone through the Internet (for up to 72 hours).

**How does this happen?** Your Gradio app runs on a Python server locally, but we use FRP to expose the local server to the Internet. FRP consists of two parts:
* FRP Client: this runs on *your* machine. We package binaries for the most common operating systems, and the [FRP Client for your system is downloaded](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/tunneling.py#L47) the first time you create a share link on your machine.
* FRP Server: this runs on Gradio's Share Server, but since the FRP Server is open-source, you can run it on your own server as well! 

The FRP Client establishes a connection from your local machine to the FRP Server, which is accessible on the internet. The FRP Server then provides a public URL that forwards incoming requests to the FRP Client, which in turn sends them to your locally running web app.

## Why Run Your Own Share Server?

You might want to run your own server for several reasons:
* **Custom domains**: Instead of `*.gradio.live`, you can use any domain your heart desires as long as you own it
* **Longer links**: when you run your own Share Server, you don't need to restrict share links from expiring after 72 hours
* **Security / privacy**: by setting up your own Share Server in your virtual private cloud, you can make your information security team happy

It's also quite straightforward. In your Gradio app, the only change you'll make is passing in the IP address to your share server, as the `share_server_address` parameter in `launch()`:

```py
import gradio as gr

app = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, "image", "image")
app.launch(share=True, share_server_address="my-gpt-wrapper.com:7000")
```

And voila!

```
Running on public URL: http://07f56cd0f87061c8a1.my-gpt-wrapper.com
```

## Setting Up A Share Server

### Prerequisites

* A **server** (e.g. EC2 machine on AWS) that is running Linux and connected to the Internet. Most servers provided by cloud providers (e.g. a `t2-small` on AWS) should do just fine, we recommend having at least 2 GB of RAM and 8 GB of disk space. You will need to be able to SSH into your server.
* The server should have an **elastic IP address** and a **domain name**. The specific instructions depend on the domain name registrar and cloud provider you use. For example, here are the instructions for [AWS using EC2 and Route53](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/connecting-a-domain-to-an-aws-ec2-instance-using-route53-69faffddda39).

**Important**: not just the root domain, but all subdomains should route to the IP address of your server. This typically means that you should have a wildcard entry in your DNS records, like the bottom-most entry here:

### 1. Install Docker (v. 20.10 or higher)

You can do this by running these commands (for this guide, we assume you are running Ubuntu) sequentially in the terminal after you have SSH'd into the server:

```console
sudo apt update
```
```console
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```
```console
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
```console
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
```
```console
apt-cache policy docker-ce
```
```console
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

Confirm that you Docker has been installed and you are running version `20.10` or higher by running: `docker version` in the terminal. You should see something like:

```
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           24.0.6
...
```

### 2. Clone This Repo

```console
git clone git@github.com:huggingface/frp.git
```

```console
cd frp
```

### 3. Edit the FRP Server Configuration File

Open the `scripts/frps.ini` file, and edit the value of the `subdomain_host` property to reflect your domain (without any prefixes). 

You can also set `bind_port`, which is the default port used to the FRP connections to something other than `7000`, or customize the 404 page (`custom_404_page`) which is shown when there is no active Gradio app connected to the Share Server.

Here's a sample customized `.ini` file:

```ini
[common]
log_level = trace
tcp_mux = true
bind_port = 7000
dashboard_port = 7001
vhost_http_port = 80
subdomain_host = my-gpt-wrapper.com
detailed_errors_to_client = false
custom_404_page = /etc/frp/my-404.html
```

Note: If you would like to change the expiry time of share linksdefault is 72 hours, edit [this line](https://github.com/huggingface/frp/blob/b0d5567f5df2bfc12a56bc8d787d23e2668ed9af/server/control.go#L213) in `server/control.go` as well.


### 4. Launch the FRP Server Docker Container

Note: you may need `sudo` permissions for these commands:

```console
docker build -f dockerfiles/Dockerfile-for-frps -t frps:0.2 .
```

```console
docker run --log-opt max-size=100m --memory=1G --cpus=1 --name frps3 -d --restart unless-stopped --network host -v ~/frp/scripts:/etc/frp frps:0.2 -c /etc/frp/frps.ini
```

Note : to create custom links, the `FRP_PROXY_NAME_PREFIX` variable can be set. For example adding the option `-e FRP_PROXY_NAME_PREFIX=demo` will generate links such as `demo1.mydomain.com`, `demo2.mydomain.com`... Leaving the variable empty will generate 18-characters random links such as `90a52f3b5898027235.mydomain.com`

### 5. Allow Traffic to Your Server

In order to make sure that users can connect to your Share Server, you need to ensure that traffic is allowed at the correct ports. You will need to allow:

* TCP traffic to port `7000` (or whichever port you chose as the `bind_port` in Step 3) 
* HTTP traffic to port `80`
* (Optionally, if you have HTTPS certificates on your domain), HTTPS traffic to port `443`

Note: If you'd like, you can restrict the IP addresses of the former rule to those people who should be able to *create* share links and you can restric the IP addresses of the latter two rules to those users who should be able to *view* share links.

If you are using AWS, here is what your security rules might look like:

<img width="1214" alt="image" src="https://github.com/huggingface/frp/assets/1778297/93760bbb-f10e-47f7-9b7e-2399a743a357">

------

And that's it! You now have your own little Share Server! As mentioned earlier, you can use it by passing the IP address and FRPS port as a single string to the `share_server_address` parameter in `launch()` like this:

```py
import gradio as gr

app = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, "image", "image")
app.launch(share=True, share_server_address="my-gpt-wrapper.com:7000")
```

**Note**: If you have installed HTTPS certificates on your Share Server, and your share links are being served through HTTPS, then you should also set `share_server_protocol="https"` in `launch()`.
